# PTD3-SERVER

This project aims to make the flash game Pok√©mon Tower Defense 3 playable again, by recreating the server and responding to the client's requests the same way the original would have.
It requires a slightly modified SWF client in order to use this server over the default (now dead/offline) one.

# Installing
You can `git clone`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, run as `python -m src`, then edit the SWF according to swf-mod.txt, or check back later once there is a more user-friendly, less error-prone way to do play it.

# Contributing
Create a GitHub Issue or contact me on Discord first.
