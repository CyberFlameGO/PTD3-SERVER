poke.MG_URL = "http://ptdtrading.com/ptd3/gameFiles/get_mystery_gift.php";


poke.SERVER_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:1234/save";
poke.MG_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:1234/mystery_gift";  (just returns an empty response, but it works out somehow)


note: there are some more URLs in code.sndgames.ptd3.screens, such as screen_Main. No need to touch them.
